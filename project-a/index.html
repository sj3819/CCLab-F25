                <p>Floralis Mutatio</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Chronicled by Sophia Jiang in the year 2025, during her explorations into the coded realms of digital nature.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p> Floralist Mutatio belongs to the The Generative Floral Family, believed to be one of the earliest forms of digital flora, which are organisms that exist in the space between algorithm and imagination. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Floralis Mutatio lives in a Pure White Canvas where color and motion coexist in silence.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Floralis Mutatio is a flower that does not root in soil but blossoms from pure energy gained through human interaction. Its translucent petals contracts and condenses in slow rhythm, mimicking the act of breathing. In the center rests the small leader creature that is excited for each new human interaction. Surrounding it are smaller celestial blooms, each pulsing gently, responding to the rhythm of their leader creature.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breathes rhythmically, giving it a lifelike, organic motion</li>
                    <li>Mutates in color, size, and petal shape with every click</li>
                    <li>Surrounded by glowing background flowers that pulse in harmony</li>
                    <li>Each click sparks a new evolution</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Petal Symphony?</span>
                Ancient digital explorers believed that Petal Symphony was a symbol of infinite creation, a creature that embodies change itself. No appearances are ever the same; each mutation feels like the blooming of a new species. It lives not in time, but in interaction, awakening only when touched by curiosity.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> By touching the surface of its world: the canvas, individuals can awaken the Petal Symphony. Each contact brings upon a surprise version of the flower, brighter and more complex than before. The longer one waits before reaching out, the larger and more radiant the bloom becomes, as if its preparing for its next rebirth.
